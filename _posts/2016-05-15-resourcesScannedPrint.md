## al-Maktabaŧ al-Waqfiyyaŧ

The largest collection of scanned books in Arabic (scanned images compiled into PDFs) with over 7,200 titles (~12,000 volumes), including editions of most major classical Islamic sources. The website is regularly updated and is searcheable by titles, author names and some other parameters; it can be browsed by categories.

Most texts are stored on [archive.org](www.archive.org) and occasionally linked to *Shamela*. The collection also includes books in languages other than Arabic.
